  "Description": "It is my pleasure to bring you Meat's Magazines! I have knocked out dozens of magazines I wanted to see most in H3, and conveniently found all the assets...elsewhere online...\nThis update to Meat's Magazines adds literally another dozen or more magazines, I lost count honestly. That means more menus, more rounds, more fun!Now extended magazines have their own menu alongside miscellaneous magazines which I will continue to dump mags into as I make them.",
